Birds freewheel through the sea breeze, mocking you in their flight. \n\nFor years you and your son have been trapped here, scavenging what you could from within these walls to survive. For years your mind has been fixated on the thought of freeom, of inventing a way out of this place. \n\nToday is the day. Your invention is almost ready. You'll soon be rid of this place forever. You just need to take one last journey into the maze, collecting feathers for what will be your last invention. \n\n[[Onwards]]\n",
