# DaedalusGame
A game created for Twine Games Jam (theme: retelling a legend) in Twine / Unity

You are Daedalus -- father, inventor, prisoner. You and your son are being held in the very prison that you designed, held here with a dangerous minotaur and little hope of escape. Can you collect enough feathers to escape the maze?
